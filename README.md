# wxTest
Hello,
I am getting started with GUI Development and wanted to try go full opensource.  
This way I think that I will be able to use it freely without care about dependency to any companies.  



## So my Editor is VS Code you could also try Codium  

Install here: 

  * https://code.visualstudio.com/download

or without telemetry / De-Microsofted version:  

  * https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases  


## My compiler is a x64 compiler nativelly on Windows MinGW-W64:  
  * https://github.com/Vuniverse0/mingwInstaller/releases  



## wxWidgets:  

 GIT build the most recent:  
  * https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets
